This challenge was set as part of [the Trilogy Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development](https://skillsforlife.edx.org/coding/frontend/landing/?s=Google-Unbranded&pkw=web%20design%20training&pcrid=624628533241&pmt=p&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=GGL%7CSKILLS-FOR-LIFE%7CSEM%7CCODING%7C-%7COFL%7CTIER-1%7CALL%7CNBD-G%7CBMM%7CPrimary%7CSubject-Matter&utm_term=web%20design%20training&s=google&k=web%20design%20training&utm_adgroupid=140443158663&utm_locationphysicalms=1006886&utm_matchtype=p&utm_network=g&utm_device=c&utm_content=624628533241&utm_placement=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqc6aBhC4ARIsAN06NmMdwBRSe3BLeaChkukN5Bbqb18220k1ku9TB2o9tzsX0xYUc-dlRWgaAuyvEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds). The starter files we were provided can be viewed in [this commit](https://github.com/paulashby/work-day-scheduler/tree/55984f06d3e3f1b25bd8878e302933f36afc211e).

The acceptance criterea were to create a web app that would:

* Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

* Persist events between refreshes of a page.
